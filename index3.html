			<p>Indoor plants - plants that are grown in rooms and in public<br> spaces. Most houseplants come from the tropics and subtropics.<br> Since residential or public premises are characterized by<br> conditions not so favorable for plants as when growing them<br> 
			in greenhouses (for example, the lateral direction of light,<br> 
			its small amount, dry air, plenty of dust, drafts, uneven<br> temperature), to achieve a healthy state and proper development<br> Plants use special tricks.</p>
